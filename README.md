** Please click on this website to view the final output of my code: https://33abhiram.github.io/NY-311-Calls-Project-using-R/

This project was assigned to me as a Final Exam for my course Statistics for Informatics during my freshman year at the University of Texas at Austin, and I acknowledge that all the code was written by me in RStudio through hours of coding practice in class and detailed lecture notes.

In this project, I use several packages in R to clean, filter and create reports on over 1 million rows of data about New York city's 311 calls, which is a dataset about resident complaints in New York City for years 2011 and 2012. My goal was to extract valuable insights from this data that could be turned into actionable hypotheses and aid current and future residents of New York city.

Here is the data dictionary:

CreatedDate - date the comlpaint was registered

ClosedDate - date the complaint was terminated/resolved

Agency - Agency Code handling the complaint

AgencyName - Agency Full Name handling the complaint

ComplaintType - Type of Complaint

Descriptor - Brief description of complaint

Borough - Borough the complaint was registered in

IncidentZip - Zip code the complaint was registered in

responsetime (user-defined variable) - duration of the complaint
